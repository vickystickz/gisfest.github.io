The goal of the integrated medical sample transportation system is to ensure that the existing health structures in Zimbabwe (the Ministry of Health and Child Care of Zimbabwe) have a strong, sustainable, and well-coordinated IMSTS for use by both partner and non-partner-funded health institutions which is well managed for improved health service delivery in Zimbabwe."

                "sessionContent": `I never thought I could use GIS to save lives. I thought saving lives was limited to Doctors, nurses and health professionals only. But working at Zipline has afforded me the opportunity to save lives by using geospatial analysis skills. Zipline is the largest medical drone delivery Company in the world now. With over 25 million miles flown, we deliver blood, vaccines and other medical products to health facilities (in deprived areas) in countries such as Rwanda, Ghana, Japan, some states in the USA and Nigeria and expanding quickly 
                to other parts of Africa. When the covid-19 pandemic was at its peak, we were instrumental in the delivery of vaccines and PPEs in Ghana and USA.Zipline has been able to achieve this through the hard work of teams such as the fulfillment and flight operations teams, health systems integrations,  Go to market and most importantly the GIS team. The GIS Team at Zipline, basically helps the company to make important 
                decisions regarding where to place a distribution center (DC). The site selection process takes into consideration the countries' keep out areas,  population coverage, number of health facilities, access to basic amenities among other things. 
                The team comprises engineers, developers and analysts who build tools and also manage all geospatial data necessary to make the drone’s flight from the DCs to the health facilities or delivery locations safe and successful. Some of the GIS processes the team handles includes spatial analysis, UAV data capture and processing, database management, 3D spatial modeling, spatial programming etc. 
                My talk will introduce Zipline as a successful medical drone logistics company and a deep but quick dive into how GIS is used to save lives at Zipline. I am hopeful that in the end, the audience will see another side of GIS that I absolutely love and come to know that there is more to GIS than just giving answers to a “where” question.`

                A lot of products are powered by geocoding services either forward geocoding or reverse geocoding. For example, when you search for an address on Google Maps, 
                Facebook Maps, Bolt or anywhere on the web, it is powered by an underlying geocoding service to give you the results. Unfortunately, this service costs thousands of 
                dollars yearly to integrate in your products especially using geocoding services from commercial organization.
                
                To optimize cost especially for startups with product(s) that is powered by geocoding service, it is therefore important to explore some open-source alternatives and 
                deploy an in-house solution using open-source tools, and this will be the focus of this workshop -- to guide participants on how to deploy a custom geocoding service 
                using open source tools.
                
                At the end of this workshop, participants will be confident in deploying their custom geocoding service for the whole of Nigeria, Africa, World, State or
                 any location of their choice, for use in their organizations, research or even as a potential startup-- Geocoding As A Service.

                This talk will showcase the innovative work being done by the Electrification Planning Unit of the Nigeria Energy Support Programme, NESP, A technical assistance 
                programme by the republic of Germany to Nigeria funded by Germany and the European Union. The programme developed activity tracks on Data collection, 
                Data management, Analytics and Dissemination which are all integrated into an all-in-one platform – The Nigeria SE4ALL Portal (https://nigeriase4all.gov.ng/),
                
                The platform comprises a website, thematic web apps, a data manager, and a minigrid monitor. The thematic web apps are for three specific market segments 
                targeting rural and off-grid electrification: Mini-Grids, Power Sector, and Solar Home Systems.
                
                The tool now enables the government to objectively craft policies regarding rural and off-grid electrification. Furthermore, the key enablers of electrification, 
                private off-grid power project developers now have a potent tool to empirically prospect factually for suitable locations for different electricity access 
                solutions right from their various bases of operation thereby reducing the upfront effort and costs associated with site prospecting and pipelining.`

                nature and boundaries of GIScience. In previous years, several researchers in defense of their expertise have tried to carve out GIScience as a discipline, but there have 
                been too many variations in definitions. In recent years, GIScience is more acceptably described as having a multidisciplinary nature. However, real societal challenges do
                 not recognize the boundaries built around our definitions of scientific disciplines. Spatial Information is essential to solving local and global challenges. Therefore, research 
                approaches should be flexible enough to match the complexity of any given problem. This article reviews successful examples of the application of GIScience to different 
                challenges.  It also recommends an approach to addressing complex problems using spatial information as an integrator of related core knowledge areas. Finally, the 
                prospects and challenges of transdisciplinary studies are fully highlighted.`

                The objective of this workshop is geared towards breaking down the basics of spatial data and spatial data analysis using python as a tool and python packages 
                developed by the GeoPython ecosystem. This workshop is beginner-friendly, but the basic idea and knowledge of python is recommended as a prerequisite for this workshop. 
                
                This workshop will first introduce users to the setting up of an anaconda environment to efficiently use python and geospatial python packages. A brief introduction to 
                python variables and general data types and structures in python.
                
                The next section will introduce handling and working with tabular data with pandas and array-like data in NumPy. Using this concept to introduce spatial vector data; its different types and components (point, line, polygon, geometry collection).
                
                At the next point, we will explain how to read and preprocess geospatial vector data (buffering, spatial filtering and joining, nearest distance analysis etc.) using geopandas and shapely libraries. 
                
                Moving on, this workshop will also introduce working with raster data using rasterio libraries as well as basic raster analytics and preprocessing (zonal statistics, Band explanation). 
                In addition , the participant of this workshop will be able to do simple raster and vector visualizations (Chlorpoleth Map,  Line Map display) using Nigeria climate and 
                environmental data as an example.
                
                Finally, users will be pointed to an alternative interface to analyse spatial data (QGIS) and cloud computing interface for spatial analytics with 
                python (GEE (Google Earth Engine and Google Colab))`
